### Survey
|data type                |Survey|
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|**summary**              |Single point measurement of leaf gas exchange.|
|**description**          |Survey measurements are typically a single measurement of the exchange of gases at a given point in time. Survey measurements can take many forms and be part of a sequence, e.g. measurement of gas exchange over a diurnal time course. Survey measurements might involve establishing chamber conditions that closely resemble ambient conditions and then taking a measurement as rapidly as possible after placing the leaf in the chamber. These type of measurements typically take less than 90 seconds and data are recorded as soon as the chamber has flushed. The goal is to measure prevailing gas fluxes. Alternatively, survey measurements can also be made under non-ambient conditions including under saturating irradiance and both saturating irradiance and saturating carbon dioxide concentration. Under some circumstances a survey measurement may include a period of stabilization to allow the leaf to acclimate to the chamber conditions set by the user.|
|**requiredProtocols**    |Where relevant, methods used to determine environmental condition set points (air temperature, relative humidity, VPD, irradiance, CO&#8322; concentration). Measurement methods, including use of ambient or altered conditions, and how long leaf was in chamber prior to data collection. Indicate if reported values are single measurements or averaged values. |

### Response of photosynthesis to intercellular CO&#8322; concentration (ACi curves)
|data type                |Response of photosynthesis to intercellular CO&#8322; concentration (ACi curves)|
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|**summary**              |A series of sequential measurements on a single leaf of leaf gas exchange with varying CO&#8322; concentration.|
|**description**          |The response of photosynthesis to intercellular carbon dioxide concentration determined by measuring the response of photosynthesis to changes in chamber carbon dioxide concentrations at saturating irradiance and stable leaf temperature. Measurements are typically made after a stabilization period to achieve steady state gas exchange. An alternative approach where CO&#8322; concentration is adjusted rapidly after no period of stabilization can also be used for some species (RACiR).|
|**requiredProtocols**      |Time period of leaf acclimation to chamber conditions, and if steady state gas exchange was achieved. Irradiance used, if it is considered saturating and how saturating light levels were determined. Sequence and timing of CO&#8322; concentration changes.|

### Response of photosynthesis to irradiance
|data type                |Response of photosynthesis to irradiance (AQ curves)|
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|**summary**              |A series of sequential measurements on a single leaf of photosynthetic rate with varying irradiance|
|**description**          |The response of photosynthesis to irradiance determined by measuring the response of photosynthesis to changes in irradiance at constant leaf temperature and atmospheric CO&#8322; concentration. Response curves can be measured slowly to allow full stomatal acclimation to each new level of irradiance (> 15 minutes at each step) or rapidly when the response of stomata is not of interest. To estimate Rlight a high number of points at low irradiance are required.   |
|**requiredProtocols**    |Time period of leaf acclimation to chamber conditions, and if steady state gas exchange was achieved. Sequence and timing of irradiance changes. Use of incident or absorbed light. State value used for leaf absorptance, if assumed or measured, and method if measured. Indicate if reported values are single measurements or averaged values. |
