# ESS-DIVE Leaf Gas Exchange Data and Metadata Reporting Format

This documentation contains guidance for the content and format of leaf gas exchange data and metadata. The reporting format comprises defined variable names and units for data tables, a methods metadata template, and instrument details template and guidance on inclusion of other related data and metadata.

## About the leaf gas exchange data and metadata reporting format

The ESS-DIVE leaf gas exchange data and metadata reporting format has been developed to meet the needs of the community for a unified reporting format. This initial effort covers the most common variables and provides templates for metadata reporting. Additional reporting requirements have been developed for seven common data types: 
	* Survey
	* Response of photosynthesis to intercellular CO2 concentration (ACi curves)
	* Photosynthetic parameters derived from ACi curves
	* Vcmax from one point
	* Response of photosynthesis to irradiance (AQ curves)
	* Photosynthetic parameters derived from AQ curves
	* Dark adapted respiration

For a full description of the reporting format, refer to our upcoming paper, “A reporting format for leaf-level gas exchange data and metadata”, Ecological Informatics (submitted).

## Funding and acknowledgements

Funding for the development of ESS-DIVE's Sample ID and metadata reporting format was provided by the US Department of Energy (DOE), Biological and Environmental Research Program, Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division, Data Management.

The format was developed with input and feedback of over 80 subject experts, including data collectors, data scientists, data users (empiricists and modelers), and instrument manufacturers. Thank you all.
