# Leaf-level gas exchange reporting format instructions

A data package containing leaf-level gas exchange data must include, at a minimum: 

1. Assemble the data table, using the standard [variableNames and variableUnits](definedVariables.md). If the data is a described [data type](dataTypesProtocols.md) under this format, then the data table must include the [required variables](requiredVariables.md) for that data type. 

2. Collate the full instrument output files, and assess the quality control level.

3. Fill in the [Methods metadata template](methodsMetadataTemplateV0.0.xlsx), ensuring that required protocols for each data type are described. See our [methods metadata guide](methodsMetadataGuide.md) for descriptions and instructions for each metadata field. Save as csv file type.

4. Fill in the [Instrument details template](instrumentDetailsTemplateV0.0.xlsx) and save as csv file type.

5. Prepare methods supplements tables to define codes used to capture sample characteristics in the data tables. See our [supplement metadata guide](supplementaryMetadataGuide.md) for guidance. Save each file as csv file type.


We will continue to work with the ESS community to improve data and metadata reporting formats for leaf-level gas exchange data. Please [contribute](contribute.md) by submitting issues, using our issue templates, or contact ess-dive-support@lbl.gov to provide any feedback on the process of formatting data, specific metadata fields or controlled vocabulary terms.
